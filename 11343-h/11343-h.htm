    <h3>
      CORNWALL TERRACE<br />
      REGENT'S PARK.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Adjoining <i>York Terrace</i>, engraved and described in No.
      358, of the MIRROR, is <i>Cornwall Terrace</i>, one of the
      earliest and most admired of all the buildings in the Park;
      although its good taste has not been so influential as might
      have been expected, on more recent structures. It is named
      after the ducal title of the present King, when Regent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornwall Terrace is from the designs of Mr. Decimus Burton,
      and is characterized by its regularity and beauty, so as to
      reflect high credit on the taste and talent of the young
      architect. The ground story is rusticated, and the principal
      stories are of the Corinthian order, with fluted shafts, well
      proportioned capitals, and an entablature of equal merit. The
      other embellishments of Cornwall Terrace are in correspondent
      taste, and the whole presents a facade of great architectural
      beauty and elegance.

      THE TIMES NEWSPAPER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>Concluded from page 292</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing over the leading articles, and some news from the
      seat of war, next is the Court Circular, describing the
      mechanism of royal and noble etiquette in right courtly
      style. The "Money Market and City Intelligence"&mdash;what a
      line for the capitalist: only watch the intensity with which
      he devours every line of the oracle, as the ancients did the
      <i>spirantia exta</i>&mdash;and weighs and considers its
      import and bearing with the Foreign News and leading
      articles. What rivets are these&mdash;"risen about 1/4 per
      cent"&mdash;and "a shade higher;" no fag or tyro ever hailed
      an illustration with greater interest. Talk to him whilst he
      is reading any other part of the paper, and he will break
      off, and join you; but when reading this, he can only spare
      you an occasional "hem," or "indeed"&mdash;his eyes still
      riveted to the column. This has been satirically termed
      "watching the turn of the market;" although every reader does
      the same, and first looks for those events in the paper which
      bear upon his interests or enjoyments; for pleasure, as well
      as industry, has her studies. Thus the lines "Drury Lane
      Theatre," and "Professional Concert" are 'Change news to a
      certain class&mdash;and a long criticism on Miss Phillips's
      first appearance in Jane Shore will ensure attention and
      sympathy, from anxiety for an actress of high promise, and
      the pathos of the play itself; and we need not insist upon
      the beneficial effect which sound criticism has on public
      taste. To pass from an account of a Concert at the Argyll
      Rooms, with its fantasias and <i>concertanti</i>, to the fact
      of 940 weavers being at present unemployed in
      Paisley,&mdash;and the death of a young man in Paris, from
      hydrophobia, is a sad transition from gay to grave&mdash;yet
      so they stand in the column. A long correspondence on
      Commercial Policy, Taxation, Finance, and Currency&mdash;we
      leave to the capitalist, the "parliament man," and other
      disciples of Adam Smith; whilst our eye descends to the
      right-hand corner, where is recorded the horrible fact of a
      mother attempting to suffocate her infant at her breast!
      Humanity sickens at such a pitch of savage crime in the
      centre of the most refined city in the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      The commencement of the third folio is a gratifying contrast
      to the last horrible incident. It describes the Anniversary
      of St. Patrick's Charity Schools, with one of the King's
      brothers presiding at the benevolent banquet, and records an
      after-dinner subscription of 540<i>l.</i>! What a delightful
      scene for the philanthropist&mdash;what a blessed picture of
      British beneficence! Yet beneath this is a piracy&mdash;a
      tale of blood, whose very recital "will harrow up thy
      soul"&mdash;the murder of the captain and crew of an American
      brig, as narrated by one man who was concealed. In the next
      column are two reports of Parish Elections, which afford more
      speculation than we are prone to indulge, as the turning-out
      of old parties and setting-up of new, and many of the petty
      feuds and jealousies that divide and distract parishes or
      large families, the little circles of the great whole. At the
      foot of this column a paragraph records the death of a
      miserly bachelor schoolmaster, who had worn the same coat
      twenty years, and on the tester of whose bed were found,
      wrapped up in old stockings &pound;1,600. in interest notes,
      commencing thirty-five years since, the compound interest of
      which would have been &pound;4,000.; and for what purpose was
      this concealment?&mdash;a dread of being required to assist
      his relatives! Yet contrast this wicked abuse with a few of
      the incidents we have recorded&mdash;the dinner of St.
      Patrick's, for instance, and is it possible to conceive a
      more despicable situation (short of crime) than this poor
      miser deserves in our chronicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third column opens to us a scene of a very opposite
      character, the Newmarket Craven Meeting&mdash;the most
      brilliant assemblage ever known there; the town crammed with
      the children of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307"
      name="page307"></a>[pg 307]</span> chance, the innkeepers
      trebling their charges, and like the Doncaster people, doing
      "noting widout the guinea." What an heterogeneous mixture of
      fine old sport, black legs and consciences, panting steeds
      and hearts bursting with expectation and despair, and the
      grand machinery of chance working with mathematical truth,
      and not unfrequently beneath luxury and the mere show of
      hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moralist will turn away from this rural pandemonium with
      disgust; but what will he say to the records of wretchedness
      and crime that fill up nearly the remainder of the folio. A
      Coroner's Inquest upon a fellow creature who "died from
      neglect, and want of common food to support life"&mdash;and
      another upon a poor girl, whose young and tender wits being
      "turned to folly,"&mdash;died by a draught of
      laudanum&mdash;are still more lamentable items in the
      calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath these inquests is a brief tale of a romantic robbery
      in an obscure department of France. The priest of a village,
      aged 80, lived in an isolated cottage with his niece. About
      midnight, he was disturbed, and on his getting out of bed,
      was bound by two men, whilst a third stood at the door. The
      robbers then proceeded to the girl's chamber, very
      ungallantly took her gold ear-rings, and by threatening her
      and her uncle with death, got possession of 300 francs. Two
      of the ruffians then proceeded to the church, broke open the
      poor-box, and took about 30 francs. They then bound again the
      old man and his niece, and departed. One of the robbers,
      however, left an agricultural tool behind him, which led to
      the discovery of two of the thieves, who are committed for
      trial. This is a perfect newspaper gem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth column has terror in its first line "Law Report,"
      and commences with an action in the Court of King's Bench,
      against the late Sheriffs of London for an illegal
      seizure&mdash;one of the glorious delights of office. The
      next portion relates to an illustrious foreigner, who stated
      that he professed to swallow fire and molten lead, "but he
      only put them into his mouth, and took them out again in a
      sly manner, for they were too hot to eat." (Much laughter.)
      He could swallow prussic acid without experiencing any ill
      effects from it; that was what he called <i>pyrotechny</i>;
      "he had no property except a wife and child, &amp;c."
    </p>
    <p>
      Next are the Police Reports, sometimes affording admirable
      studies of men and manners. The first is a case of a man
      being locked up for the night in a watch-house, "on suspicion
      of ringing a bell"&mdash;and brings to light a most
      outrageous abuse of petty power. In another case, a gang of
      robbers pursued by one set of watchmen, were suffered to
      escape by another set, who would not stir a foot beyond their
      own boundary line! Neither Shakspeare, Fielding, nor Sheridan
      have given us a better standing jest than this incident
      affords. It reminds us of the fellow who refused to take off
      Tom Ashe's coat, because it was felony to strip an
      <i>ash;</i> or the tanner who would not help the exciseman
      out of his pit without twelve hours' notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Births, Marriages, and Deaths&mdash;and the Markets, and
      Price of Stocks, in small type, which well bespeaks their
      crowded interest, wind up the sheet. Yet what thrilling
      sensations does this small portion of our sheet often impart.
      What hopes and expectations for heirs and legacy
      hunters&mdash;people who want the "quotation" of Mark Lane
      and the Coal Market&mdash;and others whose daily tone and
      temper depends on the little cramped fractions in the
      "Stocks" and "Funds." Another catches a fine frenzy from the
      "Shares," and regulates his day's movements "the very air o'
      the time" by their import&mdash;and hence he dreams of gold
      and gossamer, or sits torturing his imagination with writs
      and executions that await adverse fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are but a few of the pleasures and pains of a newspaper.
      Shenstone says the first part which an ill-natured man
      examines, is the list of bankrupts, and the bills of
      mortality; but, to prove that our object is any thing but
      ill-natured, we have glanced last at the Deaths. The paper
      over which we have been travelling, wants the Gazette and
      Parliamentary News, and a Literary feature. The Debates would
      have enabled us to illustrate the rapid marches of science
      and intellect in our times, as displayed in the present
      perfect system of parliamentary reporting. But enough has
      been said on other points to prove that the
      <i>physiognomy</i> of a newspaper is a subject of intense
      interest. In this slight sketch we have neither magnified the
      crimes, nor sported with the weaknesses; all our aim has been
      to search out points or pivots upon which the reflective
      reader may turn; the result will depend on his own frame of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, one little paragraph, one pearl appended
      to the Police Report which we must detach, viz. the
      acknowledgment of &pound;2. sent to the Bow Street office
      poor-box, the <i>seventh</i> contribution of the same amount
      of a benevolent individual (by the handwriting, a lady)
      signed "A friend to the unfortunate."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>[pg
      308]</span> Read this ye who gloat over ill-gotten wealth, or
      abuse good fortune; think of the delights of this divine
      benefactress&mdash;silent and unknown&mdash;but, above all,
      of the exceeding great reward laid up for her in heaven.

      CAT AND FIDDLE.

    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Your correspondent, double X has furnished us with a well
      written and whimsical derivation of the above ale-house sign,
      and partly by Roman patriotism and French "lingo," he traces
      it up to "<i>l'hostelle du Caton fidelle</i>." But I presume
      the article is throughout intended for pure banter&mdash;as I
      do not consider your facetious friend seriously meant that
      "no two objects in the world have less to do with each other
      than a cat and violin."
    </p>
    <p>
      How close the connexion is between fiddle and <i>cat-gut</i>,
      seems pretty well evident&mdash;for a proof, I therefore
      refer double X to any <i>cat-gut scraper</i> in his majesty's
      dominions, from the theatres royal, to Mistress Morgan's
      two-penny hop at Greenwich Fair.

      ANCIENT PLACES OF SANCTUARY IN LONDON AND WESTMINSTER.

      </div>

    <p>
      The principal sanctuaries were those in the neighbourhood of
      Fleet-street, Salisbury-court, White Friars, Ram-alley, and
      Mitre-court; Fulwood's-rents, in Holborn, Baldwin's-gardens,
      in Gray's-inn-lane; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309"
      name="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span> the Savoy, in the Strand;
      Montague-close, Deadman's-place, the Clink, the Mint, and
      Westminster. The sanctuary in the latter place was a
      structure of immense strength. Dr. Stutely, who wrote about
      the year 1724, saw it standing, and says that it was with
      very great difficulty that it was demolished. The church
      belonging to it was in the shape of a cross, and double, one
      being built over the other. It is supposed to have been built
      by Edward the Confessor. Within this sanctuary was born
      Edward V., and here his unhappy mother took refuge with her
      son, the young Duke of York, to secure him from the villanous
      proceedings of his cruel uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, who
      had possession of his elder brother. The metropolis at one
      time (says the Rev. Joseph Nightingale,) abounded with these
      haunts of villany and wretchedness. They were originally
      instituted for the most humane and pious purposes; and owe
      their origin to one of the sacred institutions of the Mosaic
      law, which appointed certain cities of refuge for persons who
      had accidentally slain any of their fellow creatures. The
      institution, as Marmonides justly observes, was a merciful
      provision both for the manslayer, that he might be preserved,
      and for the avenger, that his blood might be cooled by the
      removal of the manslayer out of his sight. In the year 1487,
      during the Pontificate of Innocent VIII. a bull was issued,
      and sent here, to lay a little restraint on the privileges of
      sanctuary. It stated, that if thieves, murderers, or robbers,
      registered as sanctuary-men, should sally out and commit
      fresh nuisances, which they frequently did, and enter again,
      in such cases they might be taken out of their sanctuaries by
      the king's officers. That as for debtors, who had taken
      sanctuary to defraud their creditors, their persons only
      should be protected; but their goods out of sanctuary, should
      be liable to seizure. As for traitors, the king was allowed
      to appoint them keepers in their sanctuaries, to prevent
      their escape. After the Reformation had gained strength,
      these places of sanctuary began to sink into contempt, and in
      the year 1697, it became absolutely necessary to take some
      legislative measures for their destruction.

    <p>
      In the last volume of the MIRROR, we gave several extracts
      from a delightful paper on <i>Landscape Gardening</i>,
      contained in a recent Number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>;
      with an abstract of Sir Henry Steuart's new method of
      transplanting trees, and a variety of information on this
      interesting department of rural economy. We are therefore
      pleased to see that the Society for the diffusion of Useful
      Knowledge, have appropriated the second part of their new
      work to what are termed "Timber Trees and their

      will exceed in usefulness and entertainment that which is now
      before us. Indeed, the Editor could scarcely have devised a
      more successful means of impressing his readers with a
      sincere love of nature and her sublime works, than by
      introducing them to the history of vegetable substances in

      <i>Picturesque Beauty of the Oak</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      A fine oak is one of the most picturesque of Trees. It
      conveys to the mind associations of strength and duration,
      which are very impressive. The oak stands up against the
      blast, and does not take, like other trees, a twisted form
      from the action of the winds. Except the cedar of Lebanon, no
      tree is so remarkable for the stoutness of its limbs: they do
      not exactly spring from the trunk, but divide from it; and
      thus it is sometimes difficult to know which is stem and
      which is branch. The twisted branches of the oak, too, add
      greatly to its beauty; and the horizontal direction of its
      boughs, spreading over a large surface, completes the idea of
      its sovereignty over all the trees of the forest. Even a
      decayed oak,&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;dry and dead,
        </p>
        <p>
          Still clad with reliques of its trophies old,
        </p>
        <p>
          Lifting to heaven its aged hoary head,
        </p>
        <p>
          Whose foot on earth Hath got but feeble hold&mdash;"
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      &mdash;even such a tree as Spenser has thus described is
      strikingly beautiful: decay in this case looks pleasing. To
      such an oak Lucan compared Pompey in his declining state.
    </p>
    <center>
      <i>The Cedar</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      The cedar of Lebanon, though it has been introduced into many
      parts of England as an ornamental tree, and has
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>[pg
      310]</span> thriven well, has not yet been planted in great
      numbers for the sake of its timber. No doubt it is more
      difficult to rear, and requires a far richer soil than the
      pine and the larch; but the principal objection to it has
      been the supposed slowness of its growth, although that does
      not appear to be very much greater than in the oak. Some
      cedars, which have been planted in a soil well adapted to
      them, at Lord Carnarvon's, at Highclere, have grown with
      extraordinary rapidity. Of the cedars planted in the royal
      garden at Chelsea, in 1683, two had, in eighty-three years,
      acquired a circumference of more than twelve feet, at two
      feet from the ground, while their branches increased over a
      circular space forty feet in diameter. Seven-and-twenty years
      afterwards the trunk of the largest one had extended more
      than half a foot in circumference; which is probably more
      than most oaks of a similar age would do during an equal
      period. The surface soil in which the Chelsea cedars throve
      so well is not by any means rich; but they seem to have been
      greatly nourished from a neighbouring pond, upon the filling
      up of which they wasted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various specimens of the cedar of Lebanon are mentioned as
      having attained a very great size in England. One planted by
      Dr. Uvedale, in the garden of the manor-house at Enfield,
      about the middle of the seventeenth century, had a girth of
      fourteen feet in 1789; eight feet of the top of it had been
      blown down by the great hurricane in 1703, but still it was
      forty feet in height. At Whitton, in Middlesex, a remarkable
      cedar was blown down in 1779. It had attained the height of
      seventy feet; the branches covered an area one hundred feet
      in diameter; the trunk was sixteen feet in circumference at
      seven feet from the ground, and twenty-one feet at the
      insertion of the great branches twelve feet above the
      surface. There were about ten principal branches or limbs,
      and their average circumference was twelve feet. About the
      age and planter of this immense tree its historians are not
      agreed, some of them referring its origin to the days of
      Elizabeth, and even alleging that it was planted by her own
      hand. Another cedar, at Hillingdon, near Uxbridge, had, at
      the presumed age of 116 years, arrived at the following
      dimensions; its height was fifty-three feet, and the spread
      of the branches ninety-six feet from east to west, and
      eighty-nine from north to south. The circumference of the
      trunk, close to the ground, was thirteen feet and a half; at
      seven feet it was twelve and a half; and at thirteen feet,
      just under the branches, it was fifteen feet eight inches.
      There were two principal branches, the one twelve feet and
      the other ten feet in girth. The first, after a length of
      eighteen inches, divided into two arms, one eight feet and a
      half, and the other seven feet ten. The other branch, soon
      after its insertion, was parted into two, of five feet and a
      half each.<a id="footnotetag2"

      <i>The Yew Tree</i>
    </center>
    <p>
      (Called <i>Taxus</i>, probably from the Greek, which
      signifies swiftness, and may allude to the velocity of an
      arrow shot from a yew-tree bow,) is a tree of no little
      celebrity, both in the military and the superstitious history
      of England. The common yew is a native of Europe, of North
      America, and of the Japanese Isles. It used to be very
      plentiful in England and Ireland, and probably also Scotland.
      Caesar mentions it as having been abundant in Gaul; and much
      of it is found in Ireland, imbedded in the earth. The trunk
      and branches grow very straight; the bark is cast annually;
      and the wood is compact, hard, and very elastic. It is
      therefore of great use in every branch of the arts in which
      firm and durable timber is required; and, before the general
      use of fire-arms, it was in high request for bows: so much of
      it was required for the latter purpose, that ships trading to
      Venice were obliged to bring ten bow staves along with every
      butt of Malmsey. The yew was also consecrated&mdash;a large
      tree, or more being in every churchyard; and they were held
      sacred.<a id="footnotetag3"
      name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
      In funeral processions the branches were carried over the
      dead by mourners, and thrown under the coffin in the grave.
      The following extract from the ancient laws of Wales will
      show the value that was there set upon these trees, and also
      how the consecrated yew of the priests had risen in value
      over the reputed sacred mistletoe of the Druids:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "A consecrated yew, its value is a pound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A misletoe branch, threescore pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An oak, sixscore pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>[pg
      311]</span> "Principal branch of an oak, thirty pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A yew tree, (not consecrated) fifteen pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sweet apple, threescore pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sour apple, thirty pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thorn-tree, seven pence halfpenny. Every tree after that,
      fourpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      By a statute made in the 5th year of Edward IV., every
      Englishman, and Irishman dwelling with Englishmen, was
      directed to have a bow of his own height made of yew,
      wych-hazel, ash, or awburne&mdash;that is, laburnum, which is
      still styled "awburne saugh," or awburne willow, in many
      parts of Scotland. His skill in the use of the long bow was
      the proud distinction of the English yeoman, and it was his
      boast that none but an Englishman could bend that powerful
      weapon. It seems that there was a peculiar art in the English
      use of this bow; for our archers did not employ all their
      muscular strength in drawing the string with the right hand,
      but thrust the whole weight of the body into the horns of the
      bow with the left. Chaucer describes his archer as carrying
      "a mighty bowe;" and the "cloth-yard shaft," which was
      discharged from this engine, is often mentioned by our old
      poets and chroniclers. The command of Richard III. at the
      battle which was fatal to him, was this:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The bowmen were the chief reliance of the English leaders in
      those bloody battles which attended our unjust contests for
      the succession to the crown of France. Some of these scenes
      are graphically described by Froissart.
    </p>
    <center>
      <i>Box</i>
    </center>
    <p>
      Is a native of all the middle and southern parts of Europe;
      and it is found in greater abundance and of a larger size in
      the countries on the west of Asia, to the south of the
      mountains of Caucasus. In many parts of France it is also
      plentiful, though generally in the character of a shrub. In
      early times it flourished upon many of the barren hills of
      England. Evelyn found it upon some of the higher hills in
      Surrey, displaying its myrtle-shaped leaves and its bright
      green in the depth of winter; and, till very recently, it
      gave to Boxhill, in that county, the charms of a delightful
      and perennial verdure. The trees have now been destroyed, and
      the name, as at other places called after the box, has become
      the monument of its former beauty.<a id="footnotetag4"
      name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet no tree so well merits cultivation&mdash;though its
      growth be slow. It is an unique among timber, and combines
      qualities which are not found existing together in any other.
      It is as close and as heavy as ebony; not very much softer
      than <i>lignumvitae</i>; it cuts better than any other wood;
      and when an edge is made of the ends of the fibres, it stands
      better than lead or tin, nay almost as well as brass. Like
      holly, the box is very retentive of its sap, and warps when
      not properly dried, though when sufficiently seasoned it
      stands well. Hence, for the wooden part of the finer tools,
      for every thing that requires strength, beauty, and polish in
      timber, there is nothing equal to it. There is one purpose
      for which box, and box alone, is properly adapted, and that
      is the forming of wood-cuts, for scientific or other
      illustrations in books. These reduce the price considerably
      in the first engraving, and also in the printing; while the
      wood-cut in box admits of as high and sharp a finish as any
      metal, and takes the ink much better. It is remarkably
      durable too; for, if the cut be not exposed to alternate
      moisture or heat, so as to warp or crush it, the number of
      thousands that it will print is almost incredible. England is
      the country where this economical mode of illustration is
      performed in the greatest perfection; and just when a
      constant demand for box was thus created, the trees available
      for the purpose had vanished from the island.
    </p>
    <center>
      <i>Mahogany</i>
    </center>
    <p>
      Is of universal use for furniture, from the common tables of
      a village inn to the splendid cabinets of a regal palace. But
      the general adoption of this wood renders a nice selection
      necessary for those articles which are costly and
      fashionable. The extensive manufacture of piano-fortes has
      much increased the demand for mahogany. This musical
      instrument, as made in England, is superior to that of any
      other part of Europe; and English piano-fortes are largely
      exported. The beauty of the case forms a point of great
      importance to the manufacturer. This circumstance adds
      nothing, of course, to the intrinsic value of the instrument;
      but it is of consequence to the maker, in giving an
      adventitious quality to the article in which he deals.
      Spanish mahogany is decidedly the most beautiful; but
      occasionally, yet not very often, the Honduras wood is of
      singular brilliancy; and it is then eagerly sought for, to be
      employed in the most expensive cabinet-work. A short time
      ago, Messrs. Broadwood, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312"
      name="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span> who have long been
      distinguished as makers of piano-fortes, gave the enormous
      sum of 3,000<i>l</i>. for three logs of mahogany. These logs,
      the produce of one tree, were each about fifteen feet long
      and thirty-eight inches wide. They were cut into veneers of
      eight to an inch. The wood, of which we have seen a specimen,
      was peculiarly beautiful, capable of receiving the highest
      polish; and, when polished, reflecting the light in the most
      varied manner, like the surface of a crystal; and, from the
      wavy form of the fibres, offering a different figure in
      whatever direction it was viewed. A new species of mahogany
      has been lately introduced in cabinet-work, which is commonly
      called Gambia. As its name imports, it comes from Africa. It
      is of a beautiful colour, but does not retain it so long as
      the Spanish and Honduras woods.

      <i>Planting</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      The publication of his Sylva, by Evelyn,<a id="footnotetag5"
      name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>
      gave a considerable impulse to planting in the time of
      Charles II.; but in the next century that duty was much
      neglected by the landed proprietors of this country. There is
      a selfish feeling, that the planter of an elm or an oak does
      not reap such an immediate profit from it himself, as will
      compensate for the expense and trouble of raising it. This is
      an extremely narrow principle, which, fortunately, the rich
      are beginning to be ashamed of. It is a positive duty of a
      landed proprietor who cuts down a tree which his grandfather
      planted, to put a young one into the ground, as a legacy to
      his own grand-children: he will otherwise leave the world
      worse than he found it. Sir Walter Scott, who is himself a
      considerable planter, has eloquently denounced that
      contracted feeling which prevents proprietors thus improving
      their estates, because the profits of plantations make a
      tardy and distant return; and we cannot better conclude than
      with a short passage from the essay in which he enforces the
      duty of planting waste lands:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The indifference to this great rural improvement arises, we
      have reason to believe, not so much out of the actual lucre
      of gain as the fatal <i>vis inertiae</i>&mdash;that indolence
      which induces the lords of the soil to be satisfied with what
      they can obtain from it by immediate rent, rather than
      encounter the expense and trouble of attempting the modes of
      amelioration which require immediate expense&mdash;and, what
      is, perhaps, more grudged by the first-born of Egypt&mdash;a
      little future attention. To such we can only say that the
      improvement by plantation is at once the easiest, the
      cheapest, and the least precarious mode of increasing the
      immediate value, as well as the future income, of their
      estates; and that therefore it is we exhort them to take to
      heart the exhortation of the dying Scotch laird to his son:
      'Be aye sticking in a tree Jock&mdash;it will be growing
      whilst you are sleeping.'"

      SWAN RIVER SETTLEMENT.
    </center>
    <p>
      (<i>Concluded from page 300</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      [We resume the description of the Swan River Settlement,
      which will be further illustrated by the annexed outline.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal productions, we may take for granted, are
      generally the same as those of New South Wales. The human
      species, in their physical qualities and endowments are the
      same. Most of them wore kangaroo cloaks, which were their
      only clothing. They carry the same kind of spears, and the
      womera, or throwing stick, as are used by those in New South
      Wales. In the summer months they frequent the sea-coast,
      where their skill in spearing fish is described as quite
      wonderful. In winter they mostly adhere to the woods on the
      higher grounds, where the kangaroos, the opossum tribe, and
      the land tortoises are plentiful. These, with birds and
      roots, constitute their sustenance. They have neither boat
      nor raft, nor did the party fall in with any thing resembling
      a hut. They made use of the word "kangaroo" and other terms
      in use at Port Jackson. The party saw only the three kinds of
      animals above-mentioned, and heard the barking of the native
      dog; no other reptiles but iguanas and lizards and a single
      snake presented themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of birds, the list is somewhat more extensive. The emu is
      frequent on the plains, and that once supposed "<i>rara
      avis</i>," the elegant black swan, was seen in the greatest
      abundance on the river to which it has lent its name, and
      particularly on Melville lake. Equally abundant were numerous
      species of the goose and duck family. White and black
      cockatoos, parrots and parroquets, were every where found.
      Pigeons and quails were seen in great quantities, and many
      melodious birds were heard in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seals were plentiful on all the islands. Captain Stirling
      says that it was not the season for whales, but their debris
      strewed the shore of Geographer's Bay. The French, in May and
      June, met with a prodigious number of whales along this part
      of the coast, and sharks equally numerous and of an enormous
      size, some of them stated to be upwards of two thousand
      pounds in weight. Vlaming mentions the vast numbers of large
      sharks on this part of the coast, and he, as well as the
      French, found the sea near the shore swarming with
      sea-snakes, the largest about nine or ten feet long. Captain
      Stirling's party procured three or four different kinds of
      good esculent fish; one in particular, a species of rock-cod,
      is described as excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bottom of the sea," says Captain Stirling, "is composed
      of calcareous sand, sometimes passing into marl or clay. On
      this may be seen growing an endless variety of marine plants,
      which appear to form the haunts and perhaps the sustenance of
      quantities of small fish. When it is considered that the bank
      extends a hundred miles from the shore, and that wherever the
      bottom is seen, it presents a moving picture of various
      animals gliding over the green surface of the vegetation, it
      is not too much to look forward to the time when a valuable
      fishery may be established on these shores. Even now, a boat
      with one or two men might be filled in a few hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      The island of Buache is admirably adapted for a fishing town.
      The anchorage close to its eastern shore in Cockburn Island
      is protected against all winds; and the island itself, of six
      or seven thousand acres, of a light sort of sand and loam, is
      well suited, as Mr. Fraser thinks, for any description of
      light garden crops. The side next the sea is fenced by a
      natural dyke of limestone, coveted with cypress, and in many
      places with an arborescent species of Metrosideros; and all
      the valleys are clothed with a gigantic species of Solanum,
      and a beautiful Brownonia. The soil in these thickets is a
      rich brown loam intermixed with blocks of limestone, and
      susceptible, Mr. Fraser says, of producing any description of
      crop. Fresh water may be had in all these valleys by digging
      to the depth of two feet. On this island Captain Stirling
      caused a garden to be planted and railed out; on which
      account he named it "Garden Island."
    </p>
    <p>
      On this island, Buache, or Garden (as the party named it)
      Captain Stirling left a cow, two ewes in lamb, and three
      goats, where, he observes, abundance of grass, and a large
      pool of water awaited them. They would be, at all events,
      perfectly free from any disturbance from the natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rottenest Island is the largest in this quarter, being about
      eight miles in length; it contains several saline lagoons,
      separated from the sea, on the north-east side, by a beach
      composed mostly of a single species of bivalve shell. Like
      Buache, it is covered with an abundant and vigorous
      vegetation, and a small species of kangaroo is said by
      Freycinet to be numerous upon it. Vlaming, who first
      discovered it, speaks in raptures of the beauties of this
      island, to which, from the multitude of rats, as he thought
      them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315"
      name="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span> to be, he gave the name of
      the "Rats' Nest." The French call this animal the <i>preamble
      ... long new</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not to be supposed that a hasty visit could enable the
      party to explore the mineralogical resources of the country.
      It appears, however, by a list of the soils and rock
      formations in Captain Stirling's report, that he brought home
      specimens of copper ore, of lead ore with silver, and also
      with arsenic, two species of magnetic iron, several varieties
      of granite, and chalcedony, and of limestone, with stalagmite
      incrustations, &amp;c. The high cliffs of Cape Naturaliste
      abound with large masses of what Mr. Fraser calls "an
      extraordinary aggregate," containing petrifactions of bivalve
      and other marine shells, every particle of which was thickly
      incrusted with minute crystals. Here, too, he says, veins of
      iron of considerable thickness were seen to traverse the rock
      in various directions; and he speaks of the caverns formed in
      the minacious schistose between the granite and the
      limestone, as something very extraordinary. They contained
      rock-salt in large quantities, forming thick incrustations on
      every part of the surface, beautifully crystallized, and
      penetrating into the most compact parts of the rock. In many
      of these caverns were very brilliant stalactites and
      stalagmites of extraordinary size adhering to the nodules of
      granite which form their bases or floors, and which are from
      forty to fifty feet above the level of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      In several parts of the limestone formation, mineral springs
      were found; one in particular was noticed within half a mile
      of the entrance into Swan River. It bubbled out at the base
      of the solid rock in a stream, whose transverse area was
      measured by Captain Stirling, and found to be from six to
      seven feet, running at the rate of three feet in a second of
      time. It was thermal, saline, pleasant to the taste, and
      some, who partook of it, attributed to it an aperient
      quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the outline of a country on which the government have
      determined to establish a colony, and over which they have
      justly, and we think judiciously, appointed Captain Stirling
      to act as lieutenant-governor. The plan on which it is to be
      founded is, in our opinion, unobjectionable. It promises the
      most advantageous terms to qualified settlers, and deserves
      only to be known to ensure as many of the most respectable
      agriculturists as may in the first instance be desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of climate, this colony and New South Wales may
      perhaps be equally salubrious, though we are disposed to
      think that the western aspect and the sea-breezes may
      preponderate in favor of the new one;&mdash;this being,
      probably, milder, as the western sides of all continents and
      large islands are, than the eastern sides, in the
      winter,&mdash;while the refreshing breezes cool the air in
      the summer. "In my opinion," says Captain Stirling, "the
      climate, considered with reference to health, is highly
      salubrious. This opinion is corroborated by that of the
      surgeon of the Success, who states in his report to me on the
      subject, that, notwithstanding the great exposure of the
      people to fatigue, to night air in the neighbourhood of
      marshy grounds, and to other causes usually productive of
      sickness, he had not a case upon his sick list, except for
      slight complaints unconnected with climate."
    </p>
    <p>
      It likewise appears, from Captain Stirling's report, that the
      thermometer, in the hot months of January, February, and
      March, averaged, in the morning, about 60 deg.; at noon,
      about 78 deg.; and in the evening 65 deg. The barometer
      averaged about 30 deg. The weather generally fine,&mdash;some
      rain and showery weather, and occasionally thunder and
      lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In geographical position it has an incalculable advantage
      over New South Wales. In the first place, it is not only much
      more conveniently situated than that colony, but is much
      nearer to, and has much more easy means of communication
      with, every part of the civilized world, the east coast of
      America perhaps excepted. The passages to it from England,
      and from the Cape of Good Hope, are shortened by nearly a
      month, and the return voyages still more. The voyage from it
      to Madras and Ceylon is little more than three weeks at all
      times of the year, and only a month from those places to it;
      while for six months in the year, namely, from November to
      April, inclusive, when the western monsoons prevail on the
      northern coast of Australia, the passage from New South Wales
      through Torres Strait, always dangerous, is then utterly
      impracticable; and that through Bass's Strait nearly so to
      merchant vessels, on account of the westerly winds which blow
      through it at all times of the year, and which generally
      oblige them to go round the southern extremity of Van
      Nieman's Land. The Success frigate left Port Jackson on the
      17th of January, and did not reach Cape Leeuwin till the 2nd
      of February, being six weeks and two days; and Captain
      Stirling observes, that the only chance, by which the passage
      could be accomplished at all, was by carrying a constant
      press of sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>[pg
      316]</span> One point of consideration,(says the writer of
      the "Hints,") in the proposed measure (although in reality of
      no essential importance to pecuniary success) is of
      considerable magnitude, as regards moral feeling and the
      pride of many&mdash;that is, there being no admission of
      convicts into the proposed colony! Without any illiberal
      sentiment, this is a disadvantage under which Port Jackson
      and Van Nieman's Land certainly suffer. Nevertheless these
      thriving colonies, in the course of thirty or forty years,
      have made surprising progress in agriculture, population,
      commerce and wealth. The situation of Port Jackson was the
      most distant from the mother country; its position was not
      peculiarly adapted to production or traffic with any part of
      the globe; therefore, the improvement can only be attributed
      to a favorable soil, free from the taxation of old European
      governments, a low fee cost, or a nominal pepper corn rent,
      which circumstances have not only been capable of maintaining
      those who adventured, but of yielding a profit for capital
      sufficient to induce others to pursue the same course.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the infancy of a colony, the certain maintenance of the
      settlers should be well established; and it is also right to
      know with what facility and at what cost, an adequate supply
      of necessaries, comforts, and even luxuries may be obtained.
      Adjacent, and favorably situated to Cockburn Sound, are the
      Mauritius, Cape of Good Hope, Timer, Java, Sumatra, and the
      East Indian Presidencies.

    <p>
      Algoa Bay, the Cape of Good Hope, furnishes cattle and sheep.
      The coast of Cockburn Sound and Swan and Canning Rivers,
      promises plenty of fish for the table&mdash;also, oil for
      use. Tea will not cost more than 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per
      pound through Java; from whence stock of cattle, poultry and
      pigs can be added of the best quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no intention in these remarks to shew the extent of
      production of which the soil and climate are capable; time
      and prosperity will be requisite to bring forward all their
      capabilities. Nothing, therefore, has been said of the
      articles grown in similar latitudes in Asia, and carried to
      Smyrna and other Turkish ports at immense distances, for
      export to England, France, and Holland. There is, however, no
      reason for supposing that silk, (equal to that of Brussa,)
      opium, madder roots, goats' wool, senna, gums, currants,
      raisins, and the highly esteemed Turkish tobacco, and various
      other productions, may not be cultivated to advantage half a
      century hence. But in the commencement, it is sufficient to
      look to <i>early, certain, and profitable returns</i>;
      without calculating upon chances of wealth, which may not be
      realized in the lifetime of the present adventurers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains only for us to offer a word of advice (says the
      writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>) to the multitudes who
      we understand are preparing to take their flight to this new
      land of Goshen,&mdash;which is this: that no one should <i>at
      present</i> think of venturing on such a step, unless he can
      carry out with him, either in his own person or in his family
      or followers, the knowledge of agriculture, and the
      capability of agricultural labour. It is quite certain that,
      for the first few years, every settler must be mainly
      indebted for the means of subsistence of himself and family
      to the produce of the soil; beyond this the country itself,
      for the first year, will afford him nothing, with the
      exception, perhaps, of a little fish&mdash;the rest must be
      raised by the labour of the ploughman and the horticulturist.
      The only settlers, therefore, who can reasonably hope to
      thrive in the infant state of the colony must consist of this
      description of persons; any others, with very few exceptions,
      must inevitably be disappointed, if not irretrievably ruined.
      A clergyman, a schoolmaster, a land-surveyor, an apothecary,
      a few small tradesmen and fishermen, may reasonably expect
      employment and make themselves useful to the new community;
      as will also a limited number of house-carpenters, joiners,
      bricklayers, black-smiths, tailors, shoemakers, and common
      labourers, the latter being required to assist in building
      habitations; but the unproductive
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>[pg
      317]</span> class, or idlers, had better wait a few years
      before they embark for a country where, as yet, there is
      neither hut nor hovel, and where the "<i>fruges consumere
      nati</i>" have unquestionably no place in society. We cannot
      forget what happened, when, a few years ago, the government
      resolved to send out, at a very considerable expense, a
      number of new settlers to improve and extend the agriculture
      of the Cape of Good Hope; giving allowances to the heads of
      parties, proportioned to their respective numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The persons best calculated for effecting the improvement of
      the colony, and, at the same time, their own condition, must
      be looked for among the English and Scotch farmers; these
      cannot fail. To such we would recommend not to encumber
      themselves, and incur a great and unnecessary expense, by
      carrying out live-stock from home, but to take them from the
      Cape of Good Hope. At Algoa Bay, which is perfectly safe for
      six months in the year, they may be supplied with every kind
      of domestic animal, in good condition, and at reasonable
      prices, which may be carried to their destination in the
      short space of twenty-eight days. Seed corn and the seeds of
      culinary vegetables may be taken from home; but of young
      plants of peaches, pomegranates, oranges, figs, and vines, it
      may be advisable to take a supply from the Cape of Good Hope.
      For these, and many other species of fruit, the climate is
      admirably adapted; and the vine, in particular, is just
      calculated for the limestone ridge which extends along the
      coast facing the western sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that apprehensions of interruption were once
      entertained from a prior settlement from France; these fears
      are however, removed by that nation having fixed on a point,
      to colonize, in latitude 25 deg. south, (which is distant
      north of the Swan River 400 miles) called Shark's Bay, within
      which there is an inlet called Freycinet's Harbour. The
      country in this neighbourhood much resembles the western
      coast.

      ALVISE SANUTO.
    </h3>
    <center>
      <i>A Venetian Story</i><a id="footnotetag7"
      name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>
    </center>
    <p>
      Alvise Sanuto was a young man of whom his country entertained
      the proudest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page318"
      name="page318"></a>[pg 318]</span> hopes. His courage had
      been gloriously tried in the battle of Lepanto, in which he
      had performed prodigies of valour. His prudence and foresight
      had been often the subject of admiration in the great council
      of the state. The old man, his father, esteemed him as the
      ornament and grace of his family: Venice pointed to him as
      one of her best citizens. Alvise was destined to fall by an
      infamous death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that period both public and private manners were
      exceedingly severe. The ladies, who gave law to them, only
      issued from their homes to go to church, wrapped up in a veil
      which hid their face and figure. The balconies of the palaces
      still present signs of this ancient severity, the parapets
      being purposely made so high and large, as to render it
      difficult to see from them. Alvise had a heart of the most
      passionate and fiery nature; he felt the imperious sway of
      love, but as yet had met with no lady on whom he could bestow
      his affections. The arrival of the French ambassador at
      Venice, in great pomp, excited public curiosity. The manners
      of the strangers bore an aspect of perfect novelty to the
      inhabitants of the republic, as the ladies who accompanied
      Amalia, the ambassador's daughter, displayed a fire and
      vivacity, which to many seemed scandalous as well as
      astonishing. Amalia was in her seventeenth year, and to
      cultivated and sprightly powers of mind, added those French
      graces, which, if they do not constitute beauty, are still
      more effectual than beauty itself in seducing the beholder.
      Alvise saw her when she was presented to the Doge, and
      regarded her as a being more than human. He gazed on her as
      if beside himself; and what female could have beheld him
      without admiration? Amalia read in the noble countenance of
      Alvise what he felt at that moment; she was affected, and,
      for the first time, her heart palpitated within her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alvise from that day was another being. He knew his unhappy
      state, and that his misfortunes could end but with his life,
      since the severe and unyielding laws of his country rendered
      all hope chimerical of ever being united with the stranger
      lady. His ardent fancy suggested to attempt any means of
      again seeing her who was dearer to him than life. His abode
      was divided from that of the ambassador by a narrow canal.
      Having procured the assistance of a French domestic, he
      passed over to the palace, and secretly entered the chamber
      of Amalia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight; and the young lady, her own thoughts perhaps
      disturbed by love, had not yet laid down, but was seeking
      from prayer consolation and rest. She knelt before the image
      of the virgin, her hands clasped in the attitude of devotion;
      and Alvise, beholding her angelic countenance lit up by the
      uncertain light of the lamp, could not restrain an
      exclamation of surprise, which roused the maiden from her
      pious reverie. Struck with the sight of him, she at first
      fancied, according to the superstitious notions of the times,
      that he was a spirit sent by her evil genius to tempt her,
      and uttered some words of holy scripture by way of exorcism;
      when Alvise, advancing, threw himself at her feet, and before
      Amalia could speak, disclosed to her, in the most passionate
      terms, his love, the inconsiderate step he had taken, and the
      certain death that awaited him should he be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terror, rather than indignation, filled the breast of Amalia.
      "Oh, heavens!" she exclaimed, "what madness could prompt you
      thus to expose your own life and my reputation? Haste, fly
      from this spot, which you have profaned; and know, that if my
      heart recoils at your death (and here she gave a deep sigh,)
      yet at my cry those would appear who would not suffer your
      insult to pass unpunished," so saying, she pointed
      imperiously to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alvise listened to her as if he had been struck down by
      lightning. "Then let me die!" he exclaimed, "for without you
      life is odious to me. You are just taking the first steps in
      this vale of tears; one day, however, your heart also will
      know the emotions of love, and then, then think of the
      unhappy Alvise; how great must have been his pangs, and how
      ardent his desire to terminate them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He now made an effort to go away; but Amalia held him, while
      she said, "Alas! I seek not thy death: live, but forget me
      from this fatal moment." "To forget thee is impossible; to
      love thee is death: thy compassion would sweeten the last
      moments of my existence!" "Alvise!" exclaimed Amalia,
      weeping, "live, if only for my sake!" "Do
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>[pg
      319]</span> you comprehend the force of these words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled at the question; but the idea of her lover dying
      in despair overcame all her scruples. "Yes, live for my
      sake," she repeated in an under tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappy beings! they were intoxicated with love, while the
      abyss was yawning beneath their feet. A spy of the state
      inquisition, who was going his rounds, saw Alvise enter the
      palace, and recognised him. Denounced before the dreadful
      tribunal, he was dragged thither that very morning. Convicted
      of entering the abode of the French ambassador, he was
      desired to explain his motives tor so doing, but remained
      obstinately silent. The members of the inquisition were
      confounded, accustomed as they were to see every thing yield
      before them, and reminded him that death would be the
      inevitable result of his silence. "Death," he replied, "had
      no terrors for me when I fought at Lepanto for the glory of
      my country and the salvation of Italy; on which day I proved,
      that under no circumstances could I ever become a traitor. I
      call heaven to witness that I am not one. But something
      dearer to me than life or fame now imposes silence on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was beheaded, and his body exposed between the two columns
      of the palace, with this inscription: "For offences against
      the statute." The populace were speechless at the sight,
      while his companions in arms, his relations and friends,
      abandoned themselves to despair. Venice presented one
      universal scene of mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the fatal day, Amalia stood upon the
      terrace of her palace, overlooking the grand canal. She
      contemplated with pleasurable melancholy the calm and even
      course of the moon, whose modest light shone in the cloudless
      sky. Her thoughts were of Alvise. To divert them, she turned
      to gaze on a long procession of illuminated gondolas, from
      which she heard a strain of plaintive music, as if of prayers
      for the dead, A dreadful presentiment seized her heart; she
      inquired the purpose of the procession, and heard, with
      unspeakable terror, that it was the solemnization of the
      funeral rites of a Venetian nobleman, who had been beheaded
      for high treason. "His name?" cried the breathless girl, in
      almost unintelligible accents: "Alvise Sanuto."
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell, as if shot; and striking her head in the fall upon
      a projecting part of the terrace, was mortally wounded, and
      expired.&mdash;<i>Lettere su Venezia</i>&mdash;<i>Translated

      INDEPENDENCE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Is the word, of all others, that Irish&mdash;men, women, and
      children&mdash;least understand; and the calmness, or rather
      indifference, with which they submit to dependence, bitter
      and miserable as it is, must be a source of deep regret to
      all "who love the land," or feel anxious to uphold the
      dignity of human kind. Let us select a few cases from our
      Irish village&mdash;such as are abundant in every
      neighbourhood. Shane Thurlough, "as dacent a boy," and
      Shane's wife, as "clane-skinned a girl," as any in the world.
      There is Shane, an active, handsome-looking fellow, leaning
      over the half-door of his cottage, kicking a hole in the wall
      with his brogue, and picking up all the large gravel within
      his reach to pelt the ducks with&mdash;those useful Irish
      scavengers. Let us speak to him. "Good morrow, Shane!" "Och!
      the bright bames of heaven on ye every day! and kindly
      welcome, my lady&mdash;and won't ye step in and
      rest&mdash;it's powerful hot, and a beautiful summer,
      sure&mdash;the Lord be praised!" "Thank you, Shane. I thought
      you were going to cut the hayfield to-day&mdash;if a heavy
      shower comes, it will be spoil'd; it has been fit for the
      sithe these two days." "Sure, it's all owing to that thief o'
      the world, Tom Parrel, my lady. Didn't he promise me the loan
      of his sithe; and, by the same token, I was to pay him for
      it; and <i>depinding</i> on that, I didn't buy one, which I
      have been threatening to do for the last two years." "But why
      don't you go to Carrick and purchase one?" "To
      Carrick!&mdash;Och, 'tis a good step to Carrick, and my toes
      are on the ground (saving your presence,) for I
      <i>depindid</i> on Tim Jarvis to tell Andy Cappler, the
      brogue-maker, to do my shoes; and, bad luck to him, the
      spalpeen! he forgot it." "Where's your pretty wife, Shane?"
      "She's in all the woe o' the world, Ma'am, dear. And she puts
      the blame of it on me, though I'm not in the faut this time,
      any how: the child's taken the small pock, and she
      <i>depindid</i> on me to tell the doctor to cut it for the
      cow-pock, and I <i>depindid</i> on Kitty Cackle, the limmer,
      to tell the doctor's own man, and thought she would not

      sight out o' mind&mdash;the never a word she tould him about
      it, and the babby has got it nataral, and the woman's in
      heart trouble (to say nothing o' myself;) and it the first,
      and all." "I am very sorry, indeed, for you have got a much
      better <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320"
      name="page320"></a>[pg 320]</span> wife than most men."
      "That's a true word, my lady&mdash;only she's fidgetty like
      sometimes, and says I don't hit the nail on the head quick
      enough; and she takes a dale more trouble than she need about
      many a thing." "I do not think I ever saw Ellen's wheel
      without flax before, Shane?" "Bad cess to the wheel;&mdash;I
      got it this morning about that too&mdash;I <i>depinded</i> on
      John Williams to bring the flax from O'Flaharty's this day
      week, and he forgot it; and she says I ought to have brought
      it myself, and I close to the spot: but where's the good?
      says I, sure he'll bring it next time." "I suppose, Shane,
      you will soon move into the new cottage, at Clurn Hill. I
      passed it to-day, and it looked so cheerful; and when you get
      there, you must take Ellen's advice, and <i>depend</i> solely
      on yourself." "Och Ma'am, dear, don't mintion it&mdash;sure
      it's that makes me so down in the mouth, this very minit.
      Sure I saw that born blackguard, Jack Waddy, and he comes in
      here, quite innocent like"&mdash;"Shane, you've an eye to
      'Squire's new lodge," says he. "Maybe I have," says I. "I am
      y'er man," says he. "How so?" says I. "Sure I'm as good as
      married to my lady's maid," said he; "and I'll spake to the
      'Squire for you, my own self." "The blessing be about you,"
      says I, quite grateful,&mdash;and we took a strong cup on the
      strength of it; and <i>depinding</i> on him, I thought all
      safe,&mdash;"and what d'ye think, my lady? Why, himself
      stalks into the place&mdash;talked the 'Squire over, to be
      sure&mdash;and without so much as by y'er lave, sates himself
      and his new wife on the laase in the house; and I may go
      whistle." "It was a great pity, Shane, that you didn't go
      yourself to Mr. Clurn." "That's a true word for ye, Ma'am,
      dear; but it's hard if a poor man can't have a frind to
      DEPIND on."&mdash;<i>Sketches of Irish Character, by Mrs.

      of Mason's Life of Gray, and Hayley's Life of Cowper. Nearly

        Yew trees&mdash;those gloomy tenants of our
        churchyards&mdash;appear to have been planted there in
        ancient times. In the will of Henry VI. there is the
        following item:&mdash;"The space between the wall of the
        church and the wall of the cloyster shall conteyne 38
        feyte, which is left for to sett in certayne trees and
        flowers, behovable and convenient for the custom of the
        said church." Several reasons may be assigned for giving
        this tree a preference to every other evergreen. It is very
        hardy, long-lived, and, though in time it attains a
        considerable height, produces branches in abundance, so low
        as to be always within reach of the hand, and at last
        affords a beautiful wood for furniture.&mdash;The date of
        the yews at Bedfont is 1704.

        Evelyn passed much of his time in planting; and his
        <i>Sylva, or a Discourse on Forest Trees</i>, is one of the
        most valuable works in the whole compass of English
        literature. He describes himself as "borne at
        <i>Wotton</i>, among the woods," situate about four miles
        from Dorking, in a fine valley leading to Leith Hill. In
        book iii. chap. 7, of his <i>Sylva</i>, he says, "To give
        an instance of what store of woods and timber of prodigious
        size were grown in our little county of Surrey, my own
        grandfather had standing at Wotton, and about that estate,
        timber that now were worth &pound;100,000. Since of what
        was left my father (who was a great preserver of wood)
        there has been &pound;30,000. worth of limber fallen by the
        axe, and the fury of the hurricane in 1703, by which
        upwards of 1,000 trees were blown down. Now, no more
        Wotton! stript and naked, and ashamed almost to own its
        name." The Wotton woods are still flourishing, and within
        the last fourteen years we have passed many delightful days
        beneath their shade. Many a time and often in our rambles
        have we met the venerated Sir Samuel Romilly in one of the
        most beautiful ridges of the park, called the
        <i>Deer-leap</i>, wooing Nature in her delightful solitudes
        of wood and glade. He resided at Leith Hill, and the
        distance thence to Wotton is but a short ride.

        Cunningham, in his account of New South Wales, recommends
        the cultivation of sugar, but he acknowledges the latitude
        of 28&deg; scarcely sufficiently warm for the purpose, and
        enters into an argument of economy, whether convicts or
        slaves would be the cheapest mode of supplying labour; but
        this system would alter the whole character of this
        proposed settlement in the neighbourhood of Cockburn Sound,
        the great feature of which is healthiness of the climate,
        and a fertility of the soil, capable of producing useful
        exportable commodities, more than sufficient to pay for
        tropical productions of luxury, raised at an increased
        expense of life and slavery; and a very little insight into

        The nobility of Venice were subject to the most rigorous
        <i>surveillance</i>, and dearly paid, occasionally, for the
        small degree of power conceded by the ducal house. The
        jealousy of the government with regard to these men was
        carried to excess. I may mention three regulations among
        the many that related to them, as illustrative of the
        galling yoke that pressed on them, amid all their pride and
        splendour. The first forbade them to leave the dominions of
        the state without the special permission of the council of
        ten; and this was granted with difficulty. The second
        prohibited them from possessing foods and chattels out of
        the state. This was with a view of preventing the danger
        that might arise from attempts to betray the republic under
        an idea of finding an asylum elsewhere. The third and most
        severe decree forbade communication with foreign
        ambassadors, under pain of death! The terror inspired by
        this was such, that not only the ministers of the court,
        but their secretaries and domestics, fled from the
        ambassadors as if they were infected with the plague. This
        decree had numerous results, and among others, one that was
        attended with truly tragical circumstances.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
